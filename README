Hello, thank you to check out this projet,
I hope you will enjoy it, this is my first try,
I m seeking for reviews and advises
you can test with user foo pass bar

Yaru is as simple web uploader written in ruby,

features are :
* multiple files upload with flash (and progress bar)
* simple upload with http form as fall back
* user authentication ,plain text with clear password or crypted like htpasswd, and ldap
* Internationalisation currently French and English only
* deletion of files uploaded
* public download as an http link (without being logged)

some screenshots in the screenshots folder!

Install notes :
make sur the destination directory (default is public/data) if writable by the webapp

* for nginx users
 -you will find an example of the nginx conf in nginx.conf if needed
 -in the config/environments/production.rb set this value or nginx will send empty files
  config.action_dispatch.x_sendfile_header = 'X-Accel-Redirect'
  see http://www.therailsway.com/2009/2/22/file-downloads-done-right
  and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3724853/rails-sends-0-byte-files-using-send-file

I have currently problems with long times uploads, I'm seeking for timeout somewhere...
I'm still investigating...
